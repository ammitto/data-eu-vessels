== Purpose

This repository contains vessels designated under European Union sanctions,
hosted by the Danish Maritime Authority (DMA).

== Source

* **Authority**: European Union (hosted by Denmark DMA)
* **URL**: https://www.dma.dk/growth-and-framework-conditions/maritime-sanctions/sanctions-against-russia-and-belarus/eu-vessel-designations
* **XLSX Download**: https://www.dma.dk/Media/639016569144709513/ImportversionListOfEUDesignatedVessels181225.xlsx
* **Format**: XLSX
* **Update Frequency**: As updated by DMA
* **Country Code**: EU

== Legal Basis

These vessels are designated under:

* Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine
* Annex XLII - List of vessels designated by the EU

== Directory Structure

├── downloaded/        # Raw downloaded XLSX files
├── processed/         # Processed YAML files (one per vessel)
└── README.adoc        # This file
```

== Data Format

Each processed vessel is stored as a YAML file with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
vessel_name: Angara
imo_number: '9179842'
date_of_application: '2024-06-25'
----

== Important Note

Vessels frequently change names. The **IMO number** is the primary unique
identifier and should be used for matching.

== Knowledge Graph Integration

This repository's processed YAML data feeds into the Ammitto knowledge graph.

When the harmonization process runs:

[source,shell]
----
# Auto-detect all data-* repos and harmonize
ammitto harmonize --scan --sources-dir /path/to/repos --output-dir ./api/v1
----

The eu_vessels data is transformed into:

* Individual JSON-LD nodes in `api/v1/node/entity/eu_vessels/{id}.jsonld`
* Sanction entries in `api/v1/node/entry/eu_vessels/{id}.jsonld`
* Lightweight search index entries
* Facet counts for filtering

== Usage

This data is part of the https://github.com/ammitto/ammitto[Ammitto] sanctions
screening system.
